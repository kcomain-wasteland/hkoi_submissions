 In a country, people love to send traditional mails instead of emails. 
 Mails are sent via the post office, and fees are paid by stamps. 
 There are stamps of different values available, and they are $0.1, 
 $0.2, $0.5, $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 and $50 stamps. 
 The people love to send mails so much that it is impossible to deal with 
 large amount of mails just by bare hands, so the post office has recently 
 bought a scanning machine to sort the mails. This machine makes the efficiency 
 of postage service to be higher than ever before, but due to the machine's limitation, 
 no more than four stamps can be stuck on the envelope of each mail. 
 To solve this problem, a computer will be set up in every post office 
 to find out what stamps should be stuck on each mail without violating 
 the restriction, and you are going to write a program to do this task.

The rules of the usage of stamps are as follows: 
A maximum of 4 stamps can be stuck on 1 mail. 
If possible, the total value of the stamps used should be equal 
to the postage fee needed. If it is impossible to find such a 
combination, the total value of stamps used should be as small as 
possible but larger than the fees required. No matter what the total 
value of stamps used is, the smallest possible number of stamps should be used.
